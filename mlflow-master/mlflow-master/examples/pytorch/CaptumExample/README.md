## Using Captum and MLflow to interpret Pytorch models

In this example, we will demonstrate the basic features of the [Captum](https://captum.ai/) interpretability,and loging those features using mlflow library through an example model trained on the Titanic survival data. 
We will first train a deep neural network on the data using PyTorch and use Captum to understand which of the features were most important and how the network reached its prediction.

you can get more details about used attributions methods used in this example

2. [integrated-gradients](https://captum.ai/docs/algorithms#primary-attribution)
3. [layer-attributions](https://captum.ai/docs/algorithms#layer-attribution)


### Running the code
To run the example via MLflow, navigate to the `mlflow/examples/pytorch/CaptumExample` directory and run the command

```
mlflow run .
```

This will run `Titanic_Captum_Interpret.py` with default parameter values, e.g.  `--max_epochs=100` and `--use_pretrained_model False`. You can see the full set of parameters in the `MLproject` file within this directory.

In order to run the file with custom parameters, run the command

```
mlflow run . -P max_epochs=X
```

where `X` is your desired value for `max_epochs`.

If you have the required modules for the file and would like to skip the creation of a conda environment, add the argument `--no-conda`.

```
mlflow run . --no-conda
```
### Viewing results in the MLflow UI

Once the code is finished executing, you can view the run's metrics, parameters, and details by running the command

```
mlflow ui
```

and navigating to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

For more details on MLflow tracking, see [the docs](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#mlflow-tracking).

### Passing custom training parameters

The parameters can be overridden via the command line:

1. max_epochs - Number of epochs to train model. Training can be interrupted early via Ctrl+C
2. lr - Learning rate
3. use_pretrained_model - If want to use pretrained model

For example:
```
mlflow run . -P max_epochs=5 -P learning_rate=0.01 -P use_pretrained_model=True
```
Or to run the training script directly with custom parameters:

```
python Titanic_Captum_Interpret.py \
    --max_epochs 50 \
    --lr 0.1
```


## Logging to a custom tracking server
To configure MLflow to log to a custom (non-default) tracking location, set the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variable, e.g. via export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000/. For more details, see [the docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#where-runs-are-recorded).
