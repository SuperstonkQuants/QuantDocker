## Ax Hyperparameter Optimization Example 
In this example, we train a Pytorch Lightning model to classify Iris flower classification dataset.
A parent run will be created during the training process,which would dump the baseline model and relevant parameters,metrics and model along with its summary,subsequently followed by a set of nested child runs, which will dump the trial results.
The best parameters would be dumped into the parent run once the experiments are completed.

### Running the code
To run the example via MLflow, navigate to the `mlflow/examples/pytorch/AxHyperOptimizationPTL` directory and run the command

```
mlflow run .
```

This will run `AxHyperOptimizationPTL.py` with the default set of parameters such as `max_epochs=3` and `total_trials=3`. You can see the default value in the `MLproject` file.

In order to run the file with custom parameters, run the command

```
mlflow run . -P max_epochs=X -P total_trials=Y
```

where `X` is your desired value for `max_epochs` and `Y` is your desired value for `total_trials`.

If you have the required modules for the file and would like to skip the creation of a conda environment, add the argument `--no-conda`.

```
mlflow run . --no-conda
```

### Viewing results in the MLflow UI

Once the code is finished executing, you can view the run's metrics, parameters, and details by running the command

```
mlflow ui
```

and navigating to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

For more details on MLflow tracking, see [the docs](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#mlflow-tracking).

### Passing custom training parameters

The parameters can be overridden via the command line:

1. max_epochs - Number of epochs to train model. Training can be interrupted early via Ctrl+C
2. total_trials - Number of experimental trials


For example:
```
mlflow run . -P max_epochs=3 -P total_trials=3
```
Or to run the training script directly with custom parameters:

```
python AxHyperOptimizationPTL.py --max_epochs 3 --total_trials 3
```


## Logging to a custom tracking server
To configure MLflow to log to a custom (non-default) tracking location, set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable, e.g. via `export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000`. For more details, see [the docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#where-runs-are-recorded).
